        <p class="first">&ldquo;Stories and images of small adventure trips in and around the state of Idaho.&rdquo; Thatâ€™s
            it in a nutshell.</p>
        <p>The capacity for natural places formed by forces awesome in power or abiding subtlety to mend the mind has been
            often extolled by poets and writers.</p>
        <p>There we are confronted by the old merism of what matters, truth and beauty. Not caricatures, talking points or
            trophies, amplified and garish, but a quiet reminder of the significance and insignificance of things.</p>
        <p>It is this I wish to relay through the small truths of <a href="/photo-tag/history">history</a> or geology that
            come to hand while developing images to match, I hope, what you would have seen had you stood by when I took
            them.</p>
